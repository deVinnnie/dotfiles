# Feh does this weird thing where the binary name is used as theme name
# This means that symlink to feh would load a different theme.
# Abuse this to define a default theme for feh.
# The 'feh' below is thus the name of theme.
#
# Default theme does:
# - Draw filename
# - Don't show menus
# - Black background instead of checkers
# - Add an action to trash an image. The default hard remove is mapped to this action
# in feh/keys. I don't want to accidently lose files...
